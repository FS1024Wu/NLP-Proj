__label__2 Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^
__label__2 Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of "Prisoners of Fate" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in "A Distant Promise" and "Girl who Stole the Star" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like "Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~", "Time of the Dreamwatch", and "Chronomantique" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.
__label__2 Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross
__label__2 an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^
__label__2 happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!
__label__2 A rare & wondeful treat: I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities.
__label__2 Better than some out there.: My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between "soft" and "loud" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest.
__label__2 TMNT Soundtrack: I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
__label__2 Legend of Dragoon Soundtrack: This soundtrack is amazing. It has all the songs you want to hear most though it doesn't have all the songs. I've played the Legend of Dragoon for a very long time. It's a great game and you really notice the music once you hear it on the soundtrack. Amazing game and music.I highly recommend it,Logan
__label__2 Great Easy Listening Tunes: This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work.
__label__1 Unfortunately it wasn't bad in the least bit.: When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last "vibe" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA.
__label__1 This is Disgusting: The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous. I own 3 German Pinschers and they are wonderful pets. I resent this type of product.
__label__1 Worst "Live" recording I've ever bought!: I bought this CD for one song only, "Steal Away". I knew it was going to be "live", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a "muzik, lounge" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was "Hot Rod Hearts", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most "live" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of "Steal Away"!
__label__1 Why so expensive??!: Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.
__label__1 Just horrible: I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame.
__label__1 Queensryche & Seattle Suck: This performance is pure garbage. Unfortunately I was at this pathetic show. The audience was mostly old geezers who were there to watch a group of other geriatric has-beens. The sound was awful, their performance of West Side Story was ridiculous, and their hatred for America was sad. Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough. It was bad enough that they would embarrass themselves by performing in front of people, but they actually recorded their disaster. Now they think they can sell this crap??
__label__1 very bad movie/DVD quality: I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality.
__label__1 Tasteless Trash: If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!
__label__1 Don't Buy: This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. DON'BUY IT!!
__label__1 Disappointing!: Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!
