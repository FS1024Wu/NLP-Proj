In my C NLP project, I implement it with sys, popen, awk, sed and so on bash cmd calls(So, it is platform dependent and strict; however, with different shell command, I can imigrate to windoes os as well only with few modification), file i/o

for parallel processing, I implement openmp, this is just a annotation before the for loop, so the interface would handle everything for you. It basiclly divide the for loop basing on the number of thread that can be spawned, and determine what are the var shared or private to prevent data racing.

To excute the b6.c file:
gcc -o b6.c -lm -fopenmp
